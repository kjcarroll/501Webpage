This is a website written for the UIUC GSLIS course LIS501 in order to showcase our final group project..
This repo also currently contains crude bash scripts to generate an XML database of XKCD comics, along with a sample of its output including tags based upon a tagging scheme generated by our group and a DTD to validate the XML against.

I feel it necessary to reiterate that the scripts contained herein are basically just a collection of hacks to complete certain goals. They should be considered to be toys to play around with, at best.

Contributors to the website code currently include:
Brian Balsamo (Balsamo1@illinois.edu)
